# Central-Pet
This is a project of website that works as a place to report and find pets in need of a home. It is intended to be my first "fullstack" project and,
while thinking about what could be of some use somehow, I came up with this idea, which is not new seeing as there are many platforms engaged in doing the same
thing that is helping pets and connecting people trying to help them too. I may be inclined to try and implement some of their ideas on the run, like the pet abbuse report system which is awesome. But for now,
this project is barely born so let's see where it takes me.

## Details
As soon as the decisions of what to use where and how are made, I'll update this section to clarify what is happening. Stay tunned.
